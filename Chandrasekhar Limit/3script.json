          "subtitle": "Definition",
          "narration": "The Chandrasekhar Limit is the maximum mass that a white dwarf star can have while remaining stable against gravitational collapse. This limit is approximately 1.4 times the mass of the Sun."
        },
        {
          "subtitle": "Background",
          "narration": "White dwarfs are the remnants of stars that were not massive enough to become neutron stars or black holes. After a star exhausts its nuclear fuel, it sheds its outer layers and leaves behind a dense core, which becomes a white dwarf. A white dwarf is supported against gravitational collapse by electron degeneracy pressure, a quantum mechanical effect arising from the Pauli Exclusion Principle. This principle states that no two electrons can occupy the same quantum state simultaneously, creating a pressure that counteracts gravity."
        },
        {
          "subtitle": "Significance",
          "narration": "If the mass of a white dwarf exceeds the Chandrasekhar Limit, electron degeneracy pressure will no longer be sufficient to counterbalance gravity, leading to the collapse of the star. Depending on the mass, this collapse can result in the formation of a neutron star or a black hole. In some cases, the collapse may lead to a supernova explosion, particularly a Type Ia supernova, where the white dwarf accretes matter from a companion star and surpasses the Chandrasekhar Limit."

        {
          "subtitle": "Origin",
          "narration": "The limit is named after the Indian-American astrophysicist Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar, who first calculated it in 1930 at the age of 19. His work was initially controversial but later became a cornerstone of modern astrophysics."
        },
        {
          "subtitle": "Formula",
          "narration": "The Chandrasekhar Limit is approximately given by: MCh ≈ 5.83/μe² M☉, where μe is the average molecular weight per electron and M☉ is the solar mass."
        },
        {
          "subtitle": "Implications",
          "narration": "The Chandrasekhar Limit has profound implications for the evolution of stars and the ultimate fate of stellar remnants. It explains why white dwarfs have a maximum mass and why more massive remnants must evolve into other exotic objects."
