          "subtitle": "Negligible Volume",
          "narration": "The actual volume occupied by gas molecules is negligible compared to the volume of the container. This means gas molecules are considered as point particles with no significant volume."

          "subtitle": "No Intermolecular Forces",
          "narration": "Except during collisions, gas molecules do not exert any attractive or repulsive forces on each other. They move independently of one another."

          "subtitle": "Elastic Collisions",
          "narration": "Collisions between gas molecules, and between molecules and the walls of the container, are perfectly elastic. This means there is no loss of kinetic energy in the system, although kinetic energy can be transferred between colliding molecules."

          "subtitle": "Average Kinetic Energy Proportional to Temperature",
          "narration": "The average kinetic energy of gas molecules is directly proportional to the absolute temperature of the gas. As temperature increases, the average kinetic energy and the speed of the gas molecules increase."

          "narration": "The pressure exerted by a gas in a container results from collisions of the gas molecules with the container walls. Each collision exerts a force on the walls, and the accumulation of these collisions results in measurable pressure"

          "subtitle": "Ideal Gas Law",

  "summary": {
    "narration": "The Kinetic Theory of Gases provides a detailed and quantitative description of gas behavior. It bridges the microscopic properties of individual molecules with the macroscopic properties of gases that we observe, such as pressure, volume, and temperature. By understanding this theory, we gain a deeper insight into the nature of gases and their behavior under various conditions."
